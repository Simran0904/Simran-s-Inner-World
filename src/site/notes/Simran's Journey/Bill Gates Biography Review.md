Bill Gates: The Giant of a [David/Goliath]?


I was excited when this book was announced. In fact so much so that I pre-ordered it!
Bill Gates’ life is more or less available in the public domain but I had an urge to hear from the horse’s mouth.

The book, written by Gates himself, delves more into his adventures than his personality. The personality traits that are regurgitated are precocious, genius, smart, independent and hyper competitive. This is all you will understand about Gates as a person. His writing style isnt much to elaborate upon since it is easy to understand and doesnt meander much. If you are looking to dive deep into his persona, you will be disappointed.

On the flip side, this book will leave you wanting for more. It starts with tracing Gates’ childhood in Seattle, his tumultuous relationship with his parents, especially his mother, who was a martinet, his experiences at his school, his love at first sight with computers, his friendships and eventually the episode of dropping out of Harvard. Basically, it is a 20 year timeline from 1956 to around 1976. Lots of recognisable people are thrown in, Paul Allen, Ed Roberts, Ric Weiland, Monte Davidoff, Steve Ballmer, Steve Wozniak and the Goliath to Bill Gates’ David, Steve Jobs!. What was missing was the analysis of how Gates dealt with the people mentioned above. For the aforementioned people, all he had to say was that they were smart but he doesnt elaborate on what struck him as “smart” or why he was fond of someone. It seemed like he treats himself like a computer, he doesn’t give people more space than is necessary.

As a computer science graduate myself, it was an exhilarating experience. I am not fond of Microsoft as a company but its beginnings are really inspiring.  The coding sessions that stretched for 4 days at times, troubles at Harvard and falling out with friends makes this book a gritty tale.

As a final word, I would like to add that anybody who loves technology and is a programming enthusiast should read this book. For all its bugs, Gates’ love for programming really shines through. He genuinely loved what he did. 

I would recommend this to anyone who loves memoirs/ biographies of tech titans. Though there is much more that I would have loved to read about but as a source code, this is a good start!

PS: The book cover on the inside has the BASIC code that Gates had written for Altair 8800, which was highly impressive!
