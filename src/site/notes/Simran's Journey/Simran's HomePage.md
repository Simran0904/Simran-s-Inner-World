I will start off this website with the most famous phrase the computing world has come across till date, Hello World!

The first seed I am planning to sow here is the same that gets sowed by every programmer on their journey to coding. 

I am a newbie at book reviews and digital gardening. Both seem interesting and yet calming to me. 

How did the idea of writing sprout?
I have been a voracious reader almost all my life. I have devoured door stopper biographies, taken a ride through fictitious worlds, learned and absorbed tricks and concepts from non fiction and developed my personality with the aid of self-help books. 
Writing came late in the picture. There are 2 particular reasons as to why I wish to write:

1. Paper has patience: I want my thoughts on paper. You can make a paper listen to anything you want. Let's try and test this patience. Recently, I had watched SATC and Carrie Bradshaw, while inspiring me with her fashion, also enticed me into writing.
2. Superior writing skills: I wish to improve my writing skills. Putting your work in the public domain means being responsible, factually and grammatically write and holding public attention. I wish to develop these skills
3. An alternate profession: I dont see myself working for a long term. I had heard a phrase few years ago, " A man should always have 2 professions: One for the kitchen and another for the soul". I wish to set up my burner and then eventually move out of the kitchen. 
4. Build over manage: Building something meaningful has always been on the radar. In the management domain, one doesnt build anything, they simply "manage". For me, this seems plain and boring at times. I want to take up new tools and work through them.
5. Growing old: I will turn 75 one day. I want to intellectually superior and sharp as a whip even at an older age. Job uses and throws you. What then remains of "you"?

Isn't ChatGPT enough?
ChatGPT is a revolutionary tool. A tool that has changed the way people seek information. I cant/wont compete againt the tool but I am sure I will be using it to the minimal. I don't want to be a slave to the tool but a master. 

That is all for my introduction. I will be updating, editing, discarding this homepage time and again just like the cells in my body behave.  Yet, one thing is sure, I will be a healthier person post the process. 

Keeping in line with my promise of publishing book reviews, here is the first review:

I hope you give it a read and provide uplifting or disparaging comments. I will keep going regardless!
